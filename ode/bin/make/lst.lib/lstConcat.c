 * Lst_Concat --
 *	Concatenate two lists. New elements are created to hold the data
 *	elements, if specified, but the elements themselves are not copied.
 *	If the elements should be duplicated to avoid confusion with another
 *	list, the Lst_Duplicate function should be called first.
 *	If LST_CONCLINK is specified, the second list is destroyed since
 *	its pointers have been corrupted and the list is no longer useable.
 *
 * Results:
 *	SUCCESS if all went well. FAILURE otherwise.
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *	New elements are created and appended the the first list.
