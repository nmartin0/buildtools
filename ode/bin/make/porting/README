odemake should build with your system's native include files. 
stdlib.bsd.h and strings.mk.h are provided here to be used as
stdlib.h and strings.h if you don't  have such files or they
will not work.

See also the files in buildtools/include. If your system is very
non-standard you may need to install all or some of those files.
